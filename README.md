# Safer Transiting for Detroit
Many Detroit residents depend on public transit, but they often have limited options for traveling to work, school, and other activities, or for getting there safely. For this project, I am interested in utilizing the data related to crime incidents and public transit to build a map application to help the residents travel in a more secure and efficient way.
